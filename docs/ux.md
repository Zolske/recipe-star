## 6. The Surface
### color scheme:
*color platte:*
![color platte](./images/color-platte_recipe-star.webp)  
White has been chosen as the background to symbolize a white table cloth. The other colors are chosen because they complement the background color nicely and give a good contrast.
### typography:
*title font:*  
![Emilys Candy](./images/font-Emilys_Candy.webp)  
**link to Google Fonts ->** [Emailys Candy](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Emilys+Candy?query=Neapolitan&preview.text=Emilys%20Candy&preview.text_type=custom)  
The font was designed by Crystal Kluge of Neapolitan. I chose the font because it looks like the kind of writing you would write with icing on a cake. The Site itself is supposed to bring a friendly and light atmosphere across. I believe, the font helps to achieve that.  
### navigation:  
*navigation:*  
![nav bar](./images/navbar.webp) ![nav icons](./images/icons-nav.webp  )  
The navigation is supposed to be easy and intuitive. Icons help the user to navigate intuitively. I also let the navbar stick, so it is always accessible.
